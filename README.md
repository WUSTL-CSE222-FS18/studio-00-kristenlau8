# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

Some things I noticed: typing "1." at the beginning of each line creates an indented ordered list. Also, the accent character makes whatever is inside a pair of accent characters is highlighted. Also, a pair of triple asterisks makes whatever is inside it bold.

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***

1. sweet potato fries
1. sushi
  1. fish
  1. rice
  1. soy sauce
  1. wasabi
1. candy
1. donuts
1. avocado toast
  * avocado
  * bread
  * fried egg
  * salt
  * pepper flakes
  * balsamic vinegar

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

#### My Heading

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

``` Java
  for (int i = 0; i <=10; i++) {
    system.out.print(i)
  }

```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

Name | Explanation
-------- | --------
Data Focused | All of these applications seem to collect data and relay it to someone else, whether it be the user or authorities or something else
Automatic | They work without the user having to do anything - they are always running and make things happen on their own (i.e. turning off lights)
Problem Solving | They seek to solve a problem that a lot of people face
Remote | Can be attached to something and the data can be read remotely

Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***

1. Nest Smart Thermostat
  1. https://nest.com/
  1. Nest is a smart thermostat that connects to the internet and automatically adjusts the temperature of a home based on the family's routines. It can also be controlled with an app so you can change the temperature remotely.
  1. This has all of the distinguishing features above - it collects data to automatically solve a problem that some families face, and it can be manipulated remotely.
1. Kolibree
  1. https://www.kolibree.com/en/
  1. Kolibree is a smart toothbrush that connects to your phone, and as you're brushing your teeth it turns it into a game that you can play.
  1. I think it also has all the distinguishing features above.

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

1. Cameron
1. 

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***

1. Andy
